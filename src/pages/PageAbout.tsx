              Hi again, as this is just an early try at a deeper look into SASS
              and some of the basics of React, I'm trying out new stuff and see
              what works. It has been an interesting Journey for me and I am
              curious to see where it will lead me eventually. If anything I
              hope you have a good one and find what you're looking for, Take
              care.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
      </main>
    </>
  );
};
